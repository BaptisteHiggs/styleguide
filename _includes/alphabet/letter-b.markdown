  - Joinery codes
      - _(If showing joinery at **1:100** makes drawing graphically heavy, do not show here. Create a **1:100** subset of general arrangement joinery drawings in L series)_
  - Wayfinding signage - free standing and wall hung; show codes and setting-out dimensions
  - Stair numbers, lift numbers, escalator numbers
  - ‘Enlarged area boxes’ referring to **1:50** enlarged plans in B series if required
      - _(Do not show any description inside the box at **1:100** scale._

  - Graphical differentiation between concrete and the other types of partition
  - Architectural metalwork systems codes
      - _(If showing metalwork at **1:100** makes drawing graphically heavy, do not show here, create a **1:100** subset of general arrangement metalwork drawings in N series)_
