Signage (wayfinding) <span class="highlight-red">1:20 1:5</span>

_Wayfinding signage elements will often be documented by a signage consultant. In that case we only do setting-out in B and E series general arrangement plans._

_Statutory signage eg FIRE DOORS KEEP CLOSED, etc, is most often associated with the
doors and is scheduled as part of the J series door schedule._
