<span class="caps">Signage (wayfinding) **1:20 1:5**</span>

_Wayfinding signage elements will often be documented by a signage consultant. In that case we only do setting-out in B and E series general arrangement plans._

_Statutory signage e.g.<span class="caps">Fire doors keep closed,</span> etc., is most often associated with the doors and is scheduled as part of the J series door schedule._
