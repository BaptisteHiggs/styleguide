Wall protection plans
<span class="highlight-red">(Graphic representation scenario) 1:100</span>
As a second preference, in the case where the quantity and variation of wall protection systems (eg in a health care project) would make F series room schedule too complex to schedule, we resort to documenting it through graphic representation.
This approach creates another subset of <span class="highlight-red">1:100</span> plans in the F series, used to graphically represent and identify wall protection systems.
