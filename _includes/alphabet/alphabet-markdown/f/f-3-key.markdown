<span class="caps">**(Graphic representation scenario) 1:100**</span>

_As a second preference, in the case where the quantity and variation of wall protection systems (e.g. in a health care project) would make F series room schedule too complex to schedule, we resort to documenting it through graphic representation._

_This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in the F series, used to graphically represent and identify wall protection systems._
