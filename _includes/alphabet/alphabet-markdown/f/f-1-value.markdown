_(Materials and finishes codes allocated to the rooms in room schedule spreadsheet sufficiently describe substrate and finishes in majority of cases._
_For more complex internal spaces (eg lift lobby, auditorium), instead of trying to code it, draw the space at <span class="highlight-red">1:50</span> scale in G series and write a note in schedule ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-I-**-**’)_
