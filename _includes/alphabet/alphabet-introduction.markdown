#BVN Alphabet

#A guide to where the information belongs within the drawing set

This chapter is a detailed listing of the items we use to describe a building.

The BVN Alphabet breaks the building into drawing groups. Each drawing group of the alphabet contains certain types of information, and is grouped either by scale (<span class="highlight-red">1:100</span>, <span class="highlight-red">1:50</span>, etc), type (elevation, section, etc), location (core, auditorium, etc), element (stair, lift, etc), or by any combination of the criteria best suited for the purpose of describing the building.

The drawing scales assigned to the letters of the BVN Alphabet are prescriptive. If a portion of the drawing (eg at <span class="highlight-red">1:100</span>) becomes graphically too heavy due to small rooms and the required amount of description, draw an ‘enlarged area reference box’, do not show any description within the box at <span class="highlight-red">1:100</span>, and show description items on a <span class="highlight-red">1:50</span> detail drawing.
