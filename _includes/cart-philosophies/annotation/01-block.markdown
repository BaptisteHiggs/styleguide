WRITING STYLE

It is very important to apply consistent writing style, with particular attention to wording and consistent use of terms.

For the vast majority of written description of the building elements, we use combinations of the generic names (CLADDING, FLOORING, UPHOLSTERY), systems and materials codes (EWS- 3, FL-3, UP-5), descriptors (PAINTED, FIXED) and the finishes codes (PT-4, COL-1) 

Write instructions in simple, clear, direct short sentences, following the principle “one expression, one simple meaning”. Avoid the use of abbreviations and acronyms, unless they are listed and described on the legend sheet.
