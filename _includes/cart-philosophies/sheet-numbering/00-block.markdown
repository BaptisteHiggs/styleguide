The described system of numbering drawings outlines our base case scenario when the numbering is left to our discretion.

Elements of the drawing numbers described here are essential for successful navigation within the set.

Drawing numbers are often requested or generated by the client, especially if we are part of a large group of consultants. Added complexity (such as ‘Zone’, ‘Phase’, ‘Wing’, etc.) of subprojects can be incorporated into the main drawing number (e.g. AR-WW-B-03-18, ww being West Wing), leaving the navigation denominator as is, in the ‘B-03-18’ format.
