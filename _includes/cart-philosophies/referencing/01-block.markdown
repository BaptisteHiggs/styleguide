ONE WAY REFERENCING

Always reference from a larger scale drawing to a more detailed-one, eg from <span class="highlight-red">1:100</span> floor plan in ‘B’ series to corresponding <span class="highlight-red">1:50</span> plan in ‘G’ series.

Always reference ‘one step at a time’. In the example above, make reference to <span class="highlight-red">1:20</span> detail of a joinery item in ‘M’ series, but only from ‘G’ series. Do not draw ‘a box within a box’ in ‘B’ series general arrangement plan.
