DO NOT BACK-REFERENCE

Back-referencing is an attempt to advise the user about the drawing number where the detail was referenced from. That piece of information is of a very little use to anyone and very difficult to keep accurate.

The same detail is likely to be referenced from multiple locations in the project which would mean you need to list in every instance the origin of the detail. Backtracking is redundant as it would ultimately take you to the general arrangement plans anyway.

‘Verbal’ back-referencing is allowable, by describing the origin of the detail in the detail title.
