USE GRIDS AND CENTRE LINES

Allow the building to ‘dimension itself’ as much as possible.

PRIORITY DIMENSIONING AND OPEN DIMENSIONS

Concentrate on critical dimensions (eg width of escape corridor). Leave non-critical dimension out of the dimension string.

RESTRICT THE USE OF RLS

Use relative heights ‘above finished floor level’ (AFFL) eg dimension the height of a handrail in millimeters.

IDENTIFY DIMENSIONS WHICH ARE NOT KNOWN

Dimensions to be determined during the construction
