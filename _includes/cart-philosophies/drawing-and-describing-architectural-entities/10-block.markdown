##### Communication
{: .caps}

Depending on the type of contract, we are often commissioned by the client to act as a _lead consultant_, which places on us the responsibility to coordinate the design information of the entire design team. The clarity of communication between us and the other consultants, and the clear delineation between our and their information is crucially important for the success of the documentation stage of the project.
