SCALES

The drawing scales listed in Chapter TWO (BVN Alphabet) and Chapter THREE (Building Components) are prescriptive

General arrangement plans have to be shown at **1:100**.

If a portion of the drawing becomes graphically too heavy due to small rooms and the required amount of description, draw a reference box to the same area enlarged at **1:50** and provide all description at the larger scale.
