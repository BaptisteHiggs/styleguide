##### Departure from the Bvn Documentation Approach
{: .caps}

There are many facets to construction documentation and many aspects which influence the way the construction documentation set will evolve. The project and contract type, builder’s preferences, consultant’s preferences, BVN team leader’s preferences, will all play a part in the sculpting of the document. Adjustments to suit a particular project are inevitable.

The decision to depart from the prescribed BVN Documentation format is at the discretion of the team leader and will depend on the requirements of the project.

That decision is a matter of professional judgment, informed by the full understanding of the BVNCART Documentation Concepts and BVNCART Focus points.

Once  greed, the altered set of rules has to be implemented consistently throughout the set.
