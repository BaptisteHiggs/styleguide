#### Veranda

The veranda is the space along the far windows &gt; here we have informal meetings or quick ‘catch-ups’. This is also where we host talks, presentations, farewells etc. There is a projector  on the south side that has surround sound speakers for these occasions. You will find all cables against the column on the south side. There is an Ipad that controls these functions located with IT/Vicky Hey.

There is a control for the blinds along the veranda kept in your drawer.

On both the north and south end you will find hot spots for brainstorms where each screen is a movable pin board or white board.

The veranda should be booked where possible.
