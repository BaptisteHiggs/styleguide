<span class="caps">Note</span>

There is a strong preference for documenting the wall protection systems in the room schedule. System codes allocated to the rooms in the room schedule spreadsheet
sufficiently describe the wall protection items in the majority of cases.

The NOTE column in the room schedule is used to describe the specific location of an item e.g.<span class="caps">‘CRASH RAIL TRM-02 TO NORTH WALL, HANDRAIL TRM-05 TO SOUTH WALL</span>

For more complex areas instead of trying to code it, write a note in schedule <span class="caps">‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-G-\*\*-\*\*</span>
